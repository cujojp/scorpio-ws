## Getting started

This is running using frappe which is a skeleton template using Express written in Coffeescript. 
For scaffolding and layout the application is based on a skeleton version of Gumby. 

### Check Dependencies

To check if you have node.js installed.
            
### Start

To start the server:
```sh
$ npm start
```

For convenience while developing, automatic restarts are provided with:
```sh
$ cake start
```

Additionally, the port and environment variables can be set. The following
example will start the server listening on port 3000 in production mode:
```sh
$ cake -p 3000 -e production start
```
